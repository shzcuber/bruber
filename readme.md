## Inspiration:
After observing numerous UCLA students seeking ride sharing options on Snapchat, we decided to build a transportation web app service for students to conveniently ride share - Bruber.

## Interact:
You can checkout and interact with the project here: [Bruber](https://bruber-git-main-shzcuber.vercel.app/)

## Run Locally:
To Run this project Locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/shzcuber/bruber
```

```
cd backend
```

```
npm i
```

```
node app.js
```

then, to start the frontend

```
cd frontend
```

```
npm i
```

```
npm start
```

Optional:
You can also activate the Landing page by:

```
cd landing
```

```
npm i
```

```
npm start
```

## How it works
- First you need to Signup/Login:

- Search Rides using the home page
![Assets/home.png](Assets/home.png)
- Which redirects you to the rides page, where you can see rides details and sign up for it
